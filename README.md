### Running this script will perform the following to the UCI HAR data set available from the URL below:

 https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
 
 1. Merge the training and test data sets
 2. Extract only the measurements of mean and standard deviation for each measurement in the set
 3. Use descriptive activity names to identify values
 4. Label the data set with those names
 5. Create a second, seperate, tidy data set containing the average value for each variable per activity and subject in each set

### What results to expect

Successfully running this script produced two data sets
 1. masterData - this set contains only the measurements of mean and standard deviation for each measurement in the set, labeled with the activity names for easy identification
 2. tidyMasterData - this set contains the average value for each variable by activity and subject

### Example of Output 

tidyMasterData.txt is an example of what the tidyMasterData set looks like
